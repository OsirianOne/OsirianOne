- 👋 Hi, I’m @OsirianOne
- 👀 I’m interested in Ubuntu-Mate, Ubuntu, Raspberry PiOS, various kinds of projects, file uses, application of ardreno and RPI integration when needed
- 🌱 I’m currently learning generating more secure from tampering, hardeningOS, reducing radio signals, when possible to protect tampering, including reliable power monitoring and supply.  Coding to take advantage of the PPPoE, using WiFi as a back up when connections drop.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on So manyu projects and interest and needs shift from time to time.  However, some project are to self prepare my skills for a *special* project for benchtechs, hoping to make wide use, wide range, elegant design if possible.  It will be the speech engine that will be my biggest worry.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
