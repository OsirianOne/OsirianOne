- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @OsirianOne
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Ubuntu-Mate, Ubuntu, Raspberry PiOS, various kinds of projects, file uses, application of ardreno and RPI integration when needed
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning generating more secure from tampering, hardeningOS, reducing radio signals, when possible to protect tampering, including reliable power monitoring and supply.  Coding to take advantage of the PPPoE, using WiFi as a back up when connections drop.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on so many projects and interest and needs shift from time to time.  However, some project are to self prepare my skills for a *special* project for benchtechs, hoping to make wide use, wide range, elegant design if possible.  It will be the speech engine that will be my biggest worry. 

- Speech CORE - The final library that will be created from Projects, Components, parameters, value interpretation, decontruct natural syntax, and sums, values and providing natural speak back, association in speech between said componenets, small screen to oututput graphical or data widgets, and 1 single or 2 dual screens that will show the final project plan and allow speech integration with preset items stored in the projects. 
- Bench build - Components, parts, intgrated tools, providing physical building with simulated other components, live build, create/edit circuit parts and connections are done, provid audio visual warning of catestrophic faiulre may result in layout.
- Projects to simulations - very low beginnning learning - desing tight integration with bench build, or set project preferences to freeflow, level of experience,
- Simulations to PCB design - There is already many out there that you can choose components lay out circuits, and manually go through simulations and then choose suppliers, inventory skus, those equate to component footprints and then into PCB theory, then orders for parts and circuit boards, etc.
-Currently looking for better circuit design to simulation software that can me used on linux. Not super impressed by any one app or software to date, they dont integrate with the parts libraries cleanly for the ones they support.  Also they do not have a good way to set group the circuits into seperate discrete builds, I.e. The keypad and housing is part of the over all design along with say the MicoController, wifi, or other connections that make up another group of circuits that are planned together to make the home assistant unit, then the sensors are seperate.  That would allow the system to test the circuits as a whole, create test scenarios, then when it comes to fabrication only have to choose the shells or hopefully at the end choose the 3D-Print outside form factor, and the system would create the BoM and the PCB design for the inside create a tight and tidy project.  Then either pro assymbly in bulk or send all the parts back to you for DIY assymbly.  So uptimately talking AI-Prototyping,

- Flaws in the system= When choosing a project design SMD should limit the chooses to same component search, only when specific and ergo or say angle to a same SMD part flag them for options, use or quote the first standard option or most purchased option if that data exists.
- Prototyping in the 3D printer (see above) - Optional long shot to include in any way through a process flow diagram for bench building and this part goes back to the bench after several iterations and the final usually is not done by the bench tech. Ingest final PCB design and physical parameters, request style, template library, simulation, modify existing templates to fit the PCB, space, cooling requirements, venting, IPC - weather rating, location of use, covert, etc. Also Test scenarios on temp, melting, holes recommendations, fit, ... etc.

- üì´ How to reach me ...
